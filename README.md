# Text Based Game
  
### Description :   
This game is inspired by the game Colossal Cave Adventure which is a game  
where you have to cross a map from rooms to rooms to reach the end of the game.  

The game does not have many rooms nor a very long story because it is not finished.  
It lacks features, rooms and a more interesting story.  

But the game works well and it has no bugs.  
  
### What I learned : 
I learned to build the game with a UML design upstream,   
also I learned the basics of the Java language and especially inheritance.  
So in the game it is possible to add features easily.  

I also learned to work better in a team.  

### Compilation :  
To compile the project you need to use a terminal in the /scr directory and use the Makefile.  
make : compiles the project  
make run : compiles and runs the project  
make clean : allows to erase all the .class of the project once we have finished  
  
### Specifications :  
The project was made in Java on Linux.   
It was a group project for school that I do with Macine a friend of mine.   
The project is in English, but the report is in French (with the UML, ...).  
Made at the end of the year 2022.
